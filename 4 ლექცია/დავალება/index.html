          <h1>World of Warcraft</h1>
          <p>
            Set in Year 25 of the King's Calendar, Vanilla WoW thrust players
            into a fractured world teeming with localized threats that hinted at
            greater cosmic horrors. King Varian Wrynn vanished from Stormwind,
            leaving Highlord Bolvar Fordragon as regent—unbeknownst to all,
            manipulated by Onyxia, the black dragon scheming in human guise as
            Lady Katrana Prestor. Heroes began humbly: Alliance adventurers
            purged the Defias Brotherhood from Westfall's Deadmines, rebels born
            of stonemason betrayal. Horde warriors cleansed Orgrimmar's Ragefire
            Chasm of shadowy cults. Dungeons like the Wailing Caverns (corrupted
            druids), Shadowfang Keep (werewolves), and Blackfathom Deeps (naga
            and Old Gods' whispers) revealed festering corruptions. Escalation
            came with Blackrock Mountain. Blackrock orcs, slaves to the fire
            elemental lord Ragnaros—summoned centuries ago by Dark Iron
            dwarves—raided the surface world. Players delved Molten Core to slay
            Ragnaros, then ascended to Blackwing Lair, confronting Nefarian,
            Deathwing's son experimenting with chromatic dragons. Onyxia fell in
            her lair beneath Stormwind, exposing Varian's kidnapping and
            restoring the king. In the south, Silithus swarmed with silithid
            insects, puppets of the qiraji empire and the Old God C'Thun,
            imprisoned since the War of the Shifting Sands. A world event, the
            Gates of Ahn'Qiraj, saw Alliance and Horde unite in the Might of
            Kalimdor, amassing resources to breach the Scarab Wall. Raids on
            Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj and Temple of Ahn'Qiraj ended with C'Thun's
            death, but his whispers lingered. Finally, Naxxramas, the Scourge's
            floating necropolis, hovered over cities, led by lich Kel'Thuzad.
            Players stormed it, purging undead remnants of the Lich King—Arthas
            Menethil, now fused with the orc shaman Ner'zhul atop Northrend's
            Frozen Throne. Victory was pyrrhic; tensions boiled in battlegrounds
            like Warsong Gulch, and Lord Kazzak reopened the Dark Portal in
            Hellfire Peninsula, heralding doom. Azeroth stabilized, but the
            portal's glow promised invasion.

          <p>
            One year later (Year 26), demons poured from the Dark Portal. Heroes
            charged through to Outland—once Draenor, shattered by Ner'zhul's
            portals during the Second War. Ruled by Illidan Stormrage, the
            "Betrayer" (exiled night elf demon hunter), Outland was a demonic
            playground. Alliance gained draenei allies—exiled eredar led by
            Prophet Velen, who fled Sargeras's corruption of their world Argus
            millennia ago, crash-landing on Draenor before the orcish Horde's
            genocide. Horde welcomed blood elves, high elf survivors of Arthas's
            Sunwell defilement, addicted to magic and following Prince Kael'thas
            Sunstrider to Illidan's side. In Hellfire Peninsula and beyond,
            players battled fel orcs from Magtheridon's Hellfire Citadel, broken
            draenei, and Legion felguards. Shattrath's naaru (holy energy
            beings) offered sanctuary via Aldor or Scryer factions. Key raids:
            Karazhan (Medivh's haunted tower, time anomalies); Gruul's Lair and
            Magtheridon's Lair (ogres and pit lord); Serpentshrine Cavern (Lady
            Vashj's naga); Tempest Keep (Kael'thas's stolen naaru ship); Black
            Temple (Akama's broken draenei betray Illidan); Zul'Aman (troll
            loa); and Sunwell Plateau, where Kael'thas summoned Kil'jaeden
            himself. Heroes slew Illidan, purified the Sunwell with Velen's aid,
            and reclaimed Outland—reconnecting Horde orcs with noble Mag'har
            under Garrosh Hellscream. Yet, as Outland fell silent, a chill wind
            blew from the north...

          <h1>Wrath of the Lich King</h1>
          <p>
            Year 27: The Lich King unleashed his Scourge on Azeroth—zombies
            overrunning cities, vrykul awakening from slumber. Heroes sailed to
            frozen Northrend, establishing bases in Borean Tundra and Howling
            Fjord. New playable death knights—former Scourge champions freed at
            Acherus: The Ebon Hold—joined both factions. Argent Crusade (Tirion
            Fordring's holy order) and Knights of the Ebon Blade (Darroth's
            death knights) forged uneasy alliances. Threats abounded: mad blue
            Dragon Aspect Malygos assaulted magic users (raids: Nexus, Eye of
            Eternity); ice trolls in Zul'Drak; proto-dragons and tuskarr
            struggles. Raids escalated: Reliquary of Souls, Magisters' Terrace
            (Sunwell cleanup); Ulduar (titan city, Old God Yogg-Saron's madness,
            Algalon's planetary reset averted); Naxxramas redux; Icecrown
            Citadel, climax atop the Frozen Throne. Arthas, crowned by
            Frostmourne, fell to the Ashbringer-wielding Tirion and players.
            Highlord Bolvar Fordragon, charred and willing, donned the Helm of
            Domination, becoming the new Lich King to contain the Scourge.
            Azeroth endured, but the Lich King's echo—and Old Gods'
            whispers—promised more wars. This trilogy forged WoW's golden age,
            blending personal heroism with world-shaking stakes.
