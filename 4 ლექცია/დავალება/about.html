          World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing
          game (MMORPG) developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment,
          released on November 23, 2004. Set in the epic fantasy universe of
          Azeroth, players choose from diverse races and classes to explore vast
          open worlds, complete thrilling quests, engage in intense PvP and PvE
          battles, and build communities in a persistent online realm. With ten
          major expansions to date—including the current The War Within (2024)
          and the upcoming Midnight (2026) as part of The Worldsoul Saga—WoW has
          amassed over 100 million lifetime accounts, peaked at 12 million
          subscribers, and generated billions in revenue, remaining one of the
          most influential games in history.
